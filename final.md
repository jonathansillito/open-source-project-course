# Final reflection

The final deliverable for this course has two parts: a written report and an oral presentation. We hope that after the course you will continue working on the project and especially that you will maintain the relationships you have developed. You are welcome to use AI tools to help you with your writing, if you find those useful.

## Written report

Please submit a (maximum) two-page report summarizing your contributions to an open source project. Your report is to have the following sections:

* Summary
* Describe the project, and why you chose the project
* For each of your contributions (possibly grouped in some way) describe
    * The contribution, why it is meaningful to the project, and why you selected it.
    * The engineering work involved, including a link to the contribution itself (pull requests, commits, triage work, etc.). Please provide relevant details about your design and implementation choices.
    * The process of contributing (and the current status of the contribution). Please provide a timeline of your work, including at what stages you sought/received feedback, and link to any relevant artifacts (e.g., the bug report, email discussion threads, etc.).
* Reflect on what you've learned through your involvement in the open source project

*Rubric* (graded out of 20)

* [7] The importance of the contributions for the project. Naturally, we understand that the first contributions by a new contributor will be smaller in scope than what might come later. Either multiple smaller contributions or fewer larger contributions are reasonable for this course.
* [7] The quality of the engineering work. This includes its fit with the design, style, etc. of the project's code base. The student's job is to explain to the grader why the implementation and design choices were well made.
* [6] Your effectiveness in following project specific processes, and applying the principles discussed in this course (socializing changes, participating socially in the project, etc.).

Please write your report in a way that helps us asses the three dimensions described in the rubric. To some extent, this can be seen as a persuasive writing. 

## Oral presentation

This will serve the role of a "final exam" for the course. Presentations will take place during the last week of class and finals week.

The content of the presentation should be similar to the written report. When explaining your contributions, please assume your audience is *not* familiar with your project.

You will have 1 minute to set up, 5 minutes to present, and 1 minutes for questions (7 minutes total).
