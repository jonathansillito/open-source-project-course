# Technical Communication and Writing Good Documentation

Status: WIP

## Learning outcomes

1. Understand why writing is important
2. Understand why writing is challenging
3. Identify the different types of writing and the roles they play in a project

## Reading

* [Why programmers don't write documentation](https://kislayverma.com/programming/why-programmers-dont-write-documentation/)
* [How to write software documentation](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/)
* [A deep dive into software documentation best practices](https://devdynamics.ai/blog/a-deep-dive-into-software-documentation-best-practices/)
* [Knowledge Software Documentation Best Practices \[With Examples\]](https://helpjuice.com/blog/software-documentation)


## Discussing
Discussion topics:

* The readings were focused on documentation, but technical communication is a much broader topic.  
  * What do you think falls under the umbrella of *technical communication*?
  * How important are each of these to a successful project?
  * Let's look at this page: [Current Drafts of FSSC Documents](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/dev/current_documents/) - This lists the top level documents for just the Fermi (formerly GLAST) Science Support Center (There were similar documents for the overall project, the two instruments, the spacecraft itself, and the mission operations center).  What type of documents to you see here?
* How much time (% of work) do you think a typical developer spends on technical communication?
  * How do you think that varies between *corporate* and *open-source* work?
  * How much do you spend when working on class assignments?
* What makes technical communication *good* or *successful*? 
  * What examples do you have of *good* technical communication?
  * What about *bad* examples?
* What types of technical communication do you think are particularly relevant for open source projects?
* How do you think your ability to write will impact your interactions within an open source project? In your career?

Let's looks at some other examples:

* [Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://peps.python.org/)
* [React Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react)

## Practicing

*The following is to be completed in groups of two or three students. While you are practicing, please feel free to ask questions and start impromptu class discussions. Also, please expect interruptions and be open to feedback!*

For this exercise, you are going to write three small pieces technical communication.  For each of these, you will be writing about the Ruby buffer overflow bug we looked at last week.  In your groups, write each of the following items:

* **Bug report** - You are the user who discovered the bug and are reporting it to the Ruby team.
* **Pull request** - You are the developer that has fixed the bug and are writing a description of the fix in preparation for the fix to be reviewed and accepted.
* "**Incident report**" - After the bug has been fixed and patched, you are writing a synopsis of the issue and how it was fixed for "upper management" which possibly includes people without a deep technical understanding of the code.

As you are writing, think about the following items:

* **Intended audience** - Who is this communication for?  Are you using appropriate terminology? How does the audience affect what you write?
* **Content** - Have you provided all the necessary information?  Have you provided it at the right level of detail?  Is there any unnecessary information that can be removed? Are there known holes in the content that you need to call out explicitly or find the information for?
* **Clarity** - Is the content easy to read and understand?  Are there things you need to expand on to clarify?  This needs to be checked against the assumptions about your audience.
* **Tone** - How does what you wrote "sound?" Is it too passive? To aggressive? Confrontational? Condescending?  How would someone you've never met before interpret your writing?

We'll share some of these and discuss/review them as a class so be ready to share.

### Post-practice discussion
* What was challenging?
* What specific issues came up as you were writing?
* Was there anything you realized you didn't understand or information you didn't have as you were writing?

## Applying
We want you to take this opportunity to become more familiar with the technical communication and documentation of the project you are working on.

For your open source project do the following:
* Identify what documentation exists.  What different types of documentation can you find?
* Identify other types of technical communication used by the project.  This could be forums, e-mail lists, bug trackers, pull requests, etc.
* Examine some of these different types of documentation or technical communication. 
  * How clear is the documentation?
  * How easy or difficult is it to find and/or navigate?
  * What good attributes/practices can you find?
  * Where could it use improvement?


## Reflecting

Submit a one-page reflection on your experience looking at the documentation and technical communication for your project. There is no "right answer" here, but you will be graded on how insightful your answers are and the depth of understanding displayed.

* What types of documentation and techcnical communication did you find?
* What was the quality?  What were the good and bad things you found?
* How important do you feel that good communication and writing skills are to your success in the project? In your career?
* Are there areas you recognize that you need to improve on?  What are they and what can you do to increase your skill?
