# Possible Open Source Projects 
The following is a list of possible open source projects that you might consider contributing to as part of this class.  This is by no mean an exhaustive or restrictive list.  It is just to give you ideas or a place to start looking if you don't already have a project in mind.

## Alumni Suggested Projects
The following projects were suggested by BYU CS Department Alumni that we reached out to.  All of these projects are either ones they are working with, are familiar with, or feel would be a good place for students new to open source to contribute to.

If you choose one of these projects you have a possible mentor already lined up as many of these alumni have volunteered to be mentors.  We've listed project with confirmed mentors first. If you don't already have a project in mind, we recommend considering the options in this section first.
